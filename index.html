        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm a Customer Experience Agent at Slack, cat mom, sometimes-writer of words, and aspiring writer of code. I love writing about life, and am really excited to learn to write code, specifically in terms of web design. </p>
        <p>I'm passionate about building community, and giving back when able to. Thus, I've co-founded a non-profit organization called Gather. Gather organizes fundraising events where women in technology can come together to meet, connect, and have a good time with others in the industry. All of our events are 100% sponsored, with proceeds going to a local women's charity in Vancouver. Sound cool? You can check out our website over <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, I also enjoy writing! This website is in dedication to that; a place where I'm able to express myself fully whether it be my deepest despairs of heartbreak, or why cats are the absolute coolest.
