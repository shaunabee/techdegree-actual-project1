        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm a Customer Experience Agent at Slack, cat mom, sometimes-writer of words, and aspiring writer of code. I love writing about life (and cats), and am really excited to learn to write code.</p>
        <p>I'm passionate about building community, and giving back when able to. Thus, I've co-founded a non-profit organization called Gather. Gather organizes fundraising events where women in technology can come together to meet, connect, and have a good time with others in the industry. All of our events are 100% sponsored, with proceeds going to a local women's charity in Vancouver. Sound cool? You can check out our website over <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, I also enjoy writing! This website is in dedication to that; a place where I'm able to express myself fully whether it be my deepest despairs of heartbreak, or why cats are the absolute coolest.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Right now, I'm learning how to design and build websites. This website is one of my first projects. Eventually, I'd like to help small to medium sized businesses and non-profit organizations build and maintain a better web presense.</p>
