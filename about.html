        <h2>What's all this about?</h2>
        <p>So, as I mentioned, I'm trying my hand at front end web development and design. This is my first project, yay! I currently work in technology at Slack as a Customer Experience Agent. I've been dabbling in front end web development on and off for the past year or so, and decided this year to take the plunge and complete Team Treehouse's TechDegree program. I'm hoping this gives me a better idea of whether this is something I can really take on. I'd love to use it for side projects, as I really enjoy my job at Slack and have no intention (at the moment) of working full time as a developer.</p>
        <p>You might also be wondering why there's an <i>Aimee</i> page on this website. Aimee was my cat that passed away last year; she was the best! Like, really the best. Check out that section of the site to learn more about her.</p>
        <p>Anyway, now I live in downtown Vancouver with my partner and our two kittens (Chip &amp; Frank). I co-organize events for Gather, do a bit of writing, laugh a lot, and watch Netflix. That's me in a nutshell.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>I want to master the process of building web sites and increase my knowledge, skills and abilities in:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Ruby</li>
          <li>Rails</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Right now, I'm learning how to design and build websites. This website is one of my first projects. Eventually, I'd like to help small to medium sized businesses and non-profit organizations build and maintain a better web presense.</p>
